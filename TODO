understand when is called this code:
  llog_debug(vte, "unhandled control char %u", ctrl);
(this happens when I do cfmakeraw on controlling tty and press CTRL+C)

make that bold and underlined text will be handled manpages, like it is in gnome-terminal

^[[H is hijacked by ncurses programs, because they use "application" mode, which switches to using ^[OH. So, ^[[F may also be hijacked, because it is not used. Use it when pressing ^[ while in application mode. But then you will have to add it to terminfo, and make it recognizable by ncurses.
So, current hack about KP_Enter must be canceled altogether, and hack about KEY_bracketleft must be changed as said here. And then change em/ repo because now it is using current hack about KP_Enter; and implement KP_Enter key via KEY_ENTER in em/ repo.

As for "less" ESCOM, it must be fixed in "less" itself. See comment about @8 in https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/383061/
